# Getting Support

Thank you for using our project! This guide will help you get the right kind of help.

## üö® Before You Ask

1.  **Search the Documentation:** Your question might be answered in our [README.md](./README.md).
2.  **Search Existing Issues:** Check if your question or problem has already been discussed in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PrjctQ/Q-Core/issues) or [GitLab Issues](https://github.com/PrjctQ/Q-Core/-/issues).

## How to Get Help

The best and fastest way to get help is through our community Discord server.

### Join our Discord Community

We have a vibrant community on Discord where you can ask questions, share your projects, and get live help from other users and maintainers.

- **Invite Link:** [Discord](https://discord.gg/sm9e48ZU)

**Once you join:**
1.  Read the `#welcome` and `#rules` channels.
2.  Post your question in the relevant help channel (e.g., `#help` or `#general`).
3.  Be patient‚Äîsomeone will help you as soon as possible!

### What to Include When Asking for Help

To help us help you faster, please provide the following information:

*   **A clear description** of your problem or question.
*   **The version** of the library you are using.
*   **Relevant code snippets** or error messages.
*   **Steps you've already taken** to try to solve the problem.

## Reporting Bugs

If you have found a **bug** or have a **feature request**, please do not use Discord. Instead, open an issue on our repository to ensure it is tracked properly.

*   **Report a Bug:** [Open a GitHub Bug Report](https://github.com/PrjctQ/Q-Core/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
*   **Suggest a Feature:** [Open a GitHub Feature Request](https://github.com/PrjctQ/Q-Core/issues/new?template=feature_request.md)

## üìù Please Note

*   **Discord is for community help.** The maintainers do not provide guaranteed 24/7 support on Discord, but we and the community will do our best to assist.
*   **Please be respectful** of our community members' time. Help others when you can, too!
