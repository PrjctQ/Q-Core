**Please always use the latest release.** Due to the early stage of development, we do not backport security fixes to older versions. The only way to ensure you have the latest security patches is to upgrade.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this library seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately to allow for coordination before public disclosure.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to `projectq.pq@gmail.com`.

### What to Include

To help us triage and resolve the issue effectively, please include the following:

-   The version of the library you are using.
-   A description of the vulnerability.
-   Steps to reproduce the issue.
-   The potential impact of the vulnerability.

We will acknowledge your report, investigate the issue, and work on a fix. We believe in working with the security community and are happy to credit researchers who help us secure our software.
